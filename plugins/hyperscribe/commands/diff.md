## Step 0 — theme preference (run first, every invocation)

```bash
PREF=""
for p in ./.hyperscribe/preference.md ~/.hyperscribe/preference.md; do
  [ -f "$p" ] && { PREF="$p"; break; }
done

if [ -z "$PREF" ]; then
  # Prompt once (Claude Code: AskUserQuestion; other agents: text prompt).
  THEME=studio; MODE=light  # populate from user answer; defaults on skip.
  mkdir -p ~/.hyperscribe; PREF=~/.hyperscribe/preference.md
  printf -- '---\ntheme: %s\nmode: %s\ncreated_at: %s\n---\n' \
    "$THEME" "$MODE" "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" > "$PREF"
fi

THEME=$(awk -F': *' '/^theme:/{print $2; exit}' "$PREF")
MODE=$(awk -F': *'  '/^mode:/{print $2; exit}'  "$PREF")
[ -z "$THEME" ] && THEME=studio
[ -z "$MODE" ]  && MODE=light
```

You are invoking Hyperscribe's diff review. The user's input:

$ARGUMENTS

## Source detection

1. **Git range** (like `main..HEAD`, `HEAD~5..HEAD`, or `abc123..def456`) — run `git diff <range>` to get the unified diff.
2. **PR URL** (e.g. `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`) — use `gh pr diff 123 -R owner/repo` or `gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/123.diff`.
3. **No args or "diff"** — assume the user will paste or already has the diff in context. Ask if unclear.

## Section checklist

A solid diff review includes:

- **Summary** — 1-paragraph Prose + ArchitectureGrid of impacted modules (tag each with `modified`, `added`, `removed`)
- **Risks** — Callouts for breaking changes, migrations, perf impact, security
- **Changes** — CodeDiff per significant file. For tiny typo-level changes, aggregate into one. For big refactors, one CodeDiff per file.
- **(Optional) Testing plan** — StepList of manual verification steps
- **(Optional) Follow-ups** — bullet list of deferred work

## Callout severity guide for diff reviews

| Severity | When |
|---|---|
| `info` | Notable but benign change (e.g., "removes unused import") |
| `note` | Context the reviewer should know (e.g., "related to issue #42") |
| `warn` | Behavior change that callers should verify |
| `danger` | Breaking change, security concern, or data-loss risk |
| `success` | Celebratory / positive note (new test coverage, perf win) |

## Render

Same bash flow as other commands — pipe JSON to the hyperscribe CLI, write to `~/.hyperscribe/out/diff-<slug>.html`, `open` it.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hyperscribe/out
OUT=~/.hyperscribe/out/diff-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).html
MODE_FLAG=""
[ "$MODE" = "light" ] && MODE_FLAG="--mode light"
[ "$MODE" = "dark" ]  && MODE_FLAG="--mode dark"

cat <<'EOF' | ~/.claude/plugins/cache/hyperscribe-marketplace/*/plugins/hyperscribe/scripts/hyperscribe --theme "$THEME" $MODE_FLAG --out "$OUT"
<the JSON you built>
EOF
open "$OUT"
```

## Avoid

- Dumping the raw diff into one giant CodeBlock — use CodeDiff per file so the before/after lanes render correctly
- Inventing risks that aren't supported by the diff content
- Using Mermaid for diff visualization unless the diff itself restructures a flow (in which case, one before-diagram / one after-diagram side by side via ArchitectureGrid with groups)
