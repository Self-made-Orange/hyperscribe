## Why Hyperscribe

Hyperscribe is directly inspired by [nicobailon/visual-explainer](https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer) — the idea that agents should reach for "open this in a browser" instead of ASCII art is theirs. What Hyperscribe changes is the contract between the model and the renderer. Visual-explainer asks the LLM to emit a complete HTML document; Hyperscribe asks it to emit a JSON envelope against a fixed catalog of 18 components, and ships the renderer itself.

That shift has three practical consequences:

- **Token cost.** A medium page of HTML runs 5,000+ output tokens. The equivalent Hyperscribe envelope is typically 200–1,500 tokens of JSON — an 80–90% reduction on the output side, which is the side that dominates latency and spend.
- **Schema-checked output.** The CLI validates the envelope before rendering. Missing required props, unknown component names, and out-of-range enums fail with a `path: message` error the model can read and retry against. HTML has no equivalent guardrail.
- **Multi-agent reuse.** The envelope format is declarative JSON — anything that can emit JSON can produce a Hyperscribe page. The Claude Code plugin is the first surface; Codex, custom agents, RAG pipelines, and hand-written tooling can target the same renderer without any LLM in the loop. The renderer is 100% offline and has no network dependencies at runtime.

Credit where it's due: `visual-explainer` pioneered the behavioral pattern (proactively open a browser tab instead of dumping ASCII), which Hyperscribe inherits wholesale. The shift to a catalog-based JSON protocol is an orthogonal tradeoff — slightly less expressive (you can't invent new layouts on the fly), significantly cheaper to run, and safer to iterate on.

## Install

### Any agent — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, … (recommended)

```bash
npx skills add Atipico1/hyperscribe
```

This installs four skills via the [open agent skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hyperscribe` | General-purpose visual HTML renderer (ships the engine) |
| `hyperscribe-slides` | Slide deck mode |
| `hyperscribe-diff` | PR / diff review page |
| `hyperscribe-share` | Deploy an output to Vercel, return a public URL |

The CLI auto-detects which agents are present (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, Warp, and 40+ more) and writes each `SKILL.md` into that agent's skill path. Pick a subset with `--skill` or target one agent with `-a`:

```bash
npx skills add Atipico1/hyperscribe --skill hyperscribe --skill hyperscribe-slides
npx skills add Atipico1/hyperscribe -a claude-code -a codex
```

The `hyperscribe` skill is the only one that carries the renderer; the other three depend on it being installed.

### Claude Code — native plugin marketplace

If you only use Claude Code and want the `/hyperscribe`, `/hyperscribe:slides`, `/hyperscribe:diff`, `/hyperscribe:share` **slash commands**, install via the plugin marketplace instead (skills alone don't register slash commands):

```
/plugin marketplace add Atipico1/hyperscribe
/plugin install hyperscribe@hyperscribe-marketplace
```

The two paths coexist — pick plugin marketplace for slash commands, `npx skills` for auto-activating SKILL.md across many agents.

### Manual use (any language / bespoke pipeline)

The renderer has zero runtime dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atipico1/hyperscribe.git
cd hyperscribe

# Pipe an A2UI envelope on stdin, write HTML to stdout or --out
echo '<envelope.json>' | node plugins/hyperscribe/scripts/render.mjs --out page.html
```

Any agent or tool that can emit the JSON envelope described in [`plugins/hyperscribe/SKILL.md`](plugins/hyperscribe/SKILL.md) can drive this renderer.

## Uninstall

```bash
# One-shot: removes all four skills from every agent (project + global scope)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Atipico1/hyperscribe/main/uninstall.sh | bash

# Or use the skills CLI directly:
npx skills remove --agent '*' hyperscribe hyperscribe-slides hyperscribe-diff hyperscribe-share
npx skills remove --global --agent '*' hyperscribe hyperscribe-slides hyperscribe-diff hyperscribe-share
```

If you installed via Claude Code plugin marketplace, remove that separately:

```
/plugin uninstall hyperscribe@hyperscribe-marketplace
```

Rendered HTML output at `~/.hyperscribe/out/` is preserved. Delete manually with `rm -rf ~/.hyperscribe` if desired.

## Quick start

Inside Claude Code, after installing the plugin:

```
> /hyperscribe "draw a simple auth flow: browser, app, identity provider, token exchange"
```

Claude picks the components (typically `Page` > `Section` > `Mermaid` + `StepList`), emits the JSON envelope, pipes it to `scripts/render.mjs`, and opens the resulting HTML file in your default browser. The output path is printed back so you can re-open or share it later.

A minimal envelope — the actual JSON Claude emits — looks like:

```json
{
  "a2ui_version": "0.9",
  "catalog": "hyperscribe/v1",
  "is_task_complete": true,
  "parts": [
    {
      "component": "hyperscribe/Page",
      "props": { "title": "Auth flow" },
      "children": [
        {
          "component": "hyperscribe/Mermaid",
          "props": {
            "kind": "sequence",
            "source": "sequenceDiagram\n  Browser->>App: GET /login\n  App->>IdP: redirect\n  IdP-->>App: code\n  App->>IdP: exchange code\n  IdP-->>App: access_token"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The renderer writes the HTML file to `~/.hyperscribe/out/` with a slugified filename and a timestamp, prints the absolute path, and exits. Re-opening the file later never re-queries the model — it is a plain HTML document on disk.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/hyperscribe` | General-purpose page. Default entry point for diagrams, tables, architectures, explainers. |
| `/hyperscribe:slides` | Forces a `SlideDeck` root and produces a slide-oriented HTML file from a topic or outline. |
| `/hyperscribe:diff` | PR / diff review. Combines `ArchitectureGrid` for impacted modules, `CodeDiff`, and `Callout` risks. |
| `/hyperscribe:share` | Deploys an existing rendered HTML file to Vercel and returns a live URL. |

## Component catalog 🎯

22 components across 10 categories. Full prop schemas, examples, and validation rules live in [`plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md).

| Category | Component | Purpose | Children |
|---|---|---|---|
| Structure | [`Page`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Root container; exactly one per envelope | required |
| Structure | [`Section`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Titled section with auto TOC anchor | allowed |
| Structure | [`Heading`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | In-section h2/h3/h4 | forbidden |
| Structure | [`Prose`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Markdown paragraph block (CommonMark + GFM) | forbidden |
| Media | [`Image`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Inline image; URL passthrough or local → base64 inline | forbidden |
| Emphasis | [`Callout`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Boxed highlight (info / note / warn / success / danger) | forbidden |
| Emphasis | [`KPICard`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Metric card with optional delta | forbidden |
| Code | [`CodeBlock`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Single code snippet with optional line highlights | forbidden |
| Code | [`CodeDiff`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Before/after unified diff hunks | forbidden |
| Diagrams | [`Mermaid`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Mermaid.js diagram (flowchart / sequence / er / state / mindmap / class) | forbidden |
| Diagrams | [`Sequence`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Native SVG sequence diagram (Notion-styled, no CDN) | forbidden |
| Diagrams | [`ArchitectureGrid`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Card-based architecture with SVG connectors | forbidden |
| Diagrams | [`FlowChart`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Native SVG directed graph (box/pill/diamond nodes, TD/LR, ranked layout) | forbidden |
| Data | [`DataTable`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Semantic HTML table with columns / rows / caption | forbidden |
| Data | [`Chart`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Chart.js wrapper (line / bar / pie / area / scatter) | forbidden |
| Data | [`PrettyChart`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Native SVG bar/line with gradient fills + soft shadow | forbidden |
| Data | [`Comparison`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | N-way comparison (`vs` or `grid` mode) | forbidden |
| Narrative | [`Timeline`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Time-ordered events (vertical or horizontal) | forbidden |
| Narrative | [`StepList`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Ordered steps / checklist with done/doing/todo/skipped state | forbidden |
| Dashboard | [`Dashboard`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | 12-col grid of panels (children via `props.panels[].child`) | forbidden |
| Slides | [`SlideDeck`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Slide container; aspect 16:9 or 4:3 | required |
| Slides | [`Slide`](plugins/hyperscribe/references/catalog.md) | Single slide (title / content / two-col / quote / image / section) | forbidden |

The design system is Notion-inspired — warm neutrals, whisper borders, Inter font fallback chain — and every visual decision is owned by the renderer. Components carry semantic data only; styling props (`color`, `backgroundColor`, `fontSize`, `className`, etc.) are rejected by the schema. If a page wants a "red warning box" the envelope asks for `Callout severity="warn"`, never a hex code.

## Themes

Four bundled themes, each shipping both **light and dark modes** in a single CSS file. Pass `--theme <name>` at render time to pick one; use `--mode light|dark` to force initial color mode (omit for `prefers-color-scheme` + localStorage).

| Name | Character | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `studio` | Warm, paper-feel — the default | Docs, long reads, stable reference pages |
| `midnight` | Cool, developer-dark — Inter Variable + OpenType | Terminal-adjacent technical content |
| `void` | Pure-black dark-first, electric blue ring accents | Product pages, launch decks, high-contrast demos |
| `gallery` | Cinematic alternating surfaces, soft diffused shadow | Executive summaries, product showcases |

Themes are pure CSS-variable overrides (`plugins/hyperscribe/themes/*.css`). Each defines tokens under `[data-theme="<name>"]` (light) and `[data-theme="<name>"][data-mode="dark"]` (dark). Semantic tones (`--hs-tone-{info|warn|success|danger}-{bg|fg}`) and surface palette (`--hs-color-surface*`) keep components legible across all four.

**Breaking change in v0.4:** `notion` is renamed to `studio`, `linear` is renamed to `midnight`. The old names no longer resolve — update any `--theme notion` / `--theme linear` calls to the new names. Running with the old names now throws `Unknown theme "notion". Available: gallery, midnight, studio, void`.

Your per-user theme + mode preference is stored at `~/.hyperscribe/preference.md` after first run. A project-local `./.hyperscribe/preference.md` overrides it. Delete either file to re-run first-run setup.

## How it works

1. **User runs a command.** In Claude Code, the user types something like `/hyperscribe "architecture for a rate limiter"`.
2. **Skill prompt loads.** The plugin injects [`SKILL.md`](plugins/hyperscribe/SKILL.md) and the command template, giving the model the catalog, envelope format, and the rule that props carry semantic data only.
3. **Claude emits JSON.** The model classifies the intent, picks components, and produces an A2UI envelope — no HTML, no CSS, no styling decisions. Unknown component names, missing required props, and out-of-range enums are caught in step 4, not left to a broken browser render.
4. **CLI validates + renders.** `plugins/hyperscribe/scripts/render.mjs` walks the envelope against the schema in `plugins/hyperscribe/spec/catalog.json`; on success it builds a single HTML document with inlined CSS and per-component SSR. Exit codes: `0` success, `1` JSON parse error, `2` schema validation failure, `3` IO error, `4` render runtime error.
5. **Self-contained HTML lands on disk.** Output is written to `~/.hyperscribe/out/<slug>-<timestamp>.html`. No network, no external CSS, no build step — the file opens on a plane.
6. **Open in browser.** `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux — the agent prints the absolute path and a one-line summary so the user can re-open or share later.

## Roadmap

- **v0.4** — locally-inlined Mermaid and Chart.js so output is truly offline-capable; streaming render for long pages; additional themes (blueprint / editorial / paper / mono).
- **v0.5** — plugin API for user-defined components, A2UI two-way sync (renderer emits state updates back to the agent), theming via `~/.hyperscribe/theme.json` at full token scope.
- **Native installer polish** — `npx skills add Atipico1/hyperscribe` already works across 45+ agents (shipped in v0.3.1); follow-ups: symlink-mode diagnostics, CI recipe, and richer per-agent integration tests.
