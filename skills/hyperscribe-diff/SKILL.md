description: Generate a visual diff review page (ArchitectureGrid for impacted modules + CodeDiff for hunks + Callouts for risks) from a git range, PR URL, or pasted diff. Use whenever the user asks for a PR review, diff summary, change impact analysis, or pastes `git diff` output. Requires the `hyperscribe` skill (renderer engine).

> **Step 0 — Preference:** Before running any renderer command, perform the theme-preference resolution block from the base `hyperscribe` skill (`~/.claude/skills/hyperscribe/SKILL.md`, section "Step 0"). It sets `$THEME` and `$RENDERER`. If absent, this wrapper falls back to `notion` + `auto`.

# Hyperscribe — Diff review mode

Produces a self-contained HTML diff review using `hyperscribe/CodeDiff`, `hyperscribe/ArchitectureGrid` (for impacted modules), and `hyperscribe/Callout` (for risks). Thin wrapper over the `hyperscribe` skill.

## When to use

- User pastes a unified diff or `git diff` output and asks for review/summary.
- User gives a PR URL (`github.com/owner/repo/pull/N`) and asks for review.
- User gives a git range (`main..HEAD`, `HEAD~5..HEAD`, SHA range).
- User says "review these changes", "what changed", "impact of this diff".

Do **not** use for: generic commit history summaries (no concrete diff), feature spec writing, or rendering a single code snippet (use `hyperscribe` with `CodeBlock`).

## Source detection

1. **Git range** — run `git diff <range>` to get the unified diff.
2. **PR URL** — use `gh pr diff <N> -R owner/repo` or `gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/<N>.diff`.
3. **Pasted diff** — use the provided text directly.
4. **No clear source** — ask the user before continuing.

## Section checklist

A solid diff review includes:

- **Summary** — 1-paragraph `Prose` + `ArchitectureGrid` of impacted modules (tag each `modified` / `added` / `removed`)
- **Risks** — `Callout`s for breaking changes, migrations, perf, security
- **Changes** — one `CodeDiff` per significant file. Aggregate tiny typo-level changes; split big refactors by file.
- **(Optional) Testing plan** — `StepList` of manual verification steps
- **(Optional) Follow-ups** — bullet list of deferred work

## Callout severity guide

| Severity | When |
|---|---|
| `info` | Notable but benign (e.g., removes unused import) |
| `note` | Context reviewer should know (e.g., related to issue #42) |
| `warn` | Behavior change callers should verify |
| `danger` | Breaking change, security concern, data-loss risk |
| `success` | Celebratory (new test coverage, perf win) |

## Render

Same as the base `hyperscribe` skill — resolve renderer, pipe JSON, write HTML, open.

```bash
HS=$(for p in \
  ./.claude/skills/hyperscribe ~/.claude/skills/hyperscribe \
  ./.codex/skills/hyperscribe ~/.codex/skills/hyperscribe \
  ./.cursor/skills/hyperscribe ~/.cursor/skills/hyperscribe \
  ./.opencode/skills/hyperscribe ~/.opencode/skills/hyperscribe \
  ~/.claude/plugins/cache/hyperscribe-marketplace/*/plugins/hyperscribe
do [ -x "$p/scripts/hyperscribe" ] && { echo "$p/scripts/hyperscribe"; break; }; done)

if [ -z "$HS" ]; then
  echo "hyperscribe renderer not found. Install with: npx skills add Atipico1/hyperscribe" >&2
  exit 1
fi

mkdir -p ~/.hyperscribe/out
OUT=~/.hyperscribe/out/diff-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).html
cat <<'EOF' | "$HS" --theme "${THEME:-notion}" --renderer "${RENDERER:-auto}" --out "$OUT"
<the JSON you built>
EOF
open "$OUT"
```

## Avoid

- Dumping the raw diff into one giant `CodeBlock` — use `CodeDiff` per file so before/after lanes render.
- Inventing risks not supported by the diff content.
- Using `Mermaid` for diff visualization unless the diff itself restructures a flow (then: before/after `ArchitectureGrid` side by side).
